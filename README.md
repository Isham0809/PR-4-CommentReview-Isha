# Comment/Review Project

This documentation outlines the Comment/Review project that uses emojis as a rating system and a feedback field. Users can select emojis as a rating (1 to 5), which are stored in an array, and this data is dynamically displayed on another card in a carousel format.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

# Features

1. Emoji Rating System

    - Users can rate from 1 to 5 by selecting emojis.

    - Each emoji represents a specific rating.

    - The selected emoji is stored in an array for processing or display.

2. Feedback Field

    - Users can provide written feedback alongside their emoji rating.

    - Feedback is stored and associated with the corresponding emoji rating.

3. Dynamic Carousel Display

    - User ratings and feedback are displayed in a carousel format.
